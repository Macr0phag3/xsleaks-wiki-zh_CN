# 实验型功能

本节介绍影响实验型功能的 XS-Leaks。实验型功能通常隐藏在浏览器的偏好设置下，其具体规范也正在讨论中。了解这些功能，并在实现的早期阶段就开始关注它们的发展是非常重要的，这样可以防止出现全新类型的 XS-Leaks。

This section presents XS-Leaks that affect experimental features. Experimental features are usually hidden under a browser preference flag and their exact specification is under active discussion. It's important to be aware of these features and follow their development from the early stages of implementation to prevent XS-Leaks from happening.
